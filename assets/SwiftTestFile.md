  # SwiftTestFile.swift
  # Code Explanation

The provided code is written in Swift, a programming language developed by Apple for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development.

### Functions:
1. **calculateBMI**: 
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `weight`: A `Double` value representing the weight of a person in kilograms.
     - `height`: A `Double` value representing the height of a person in meters.
   - **Operation**: Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person using the formula `weight / (height * height)`.
   - **Return**: Returns the calculated BMI as a `Double`.

2. **getHealthRecommendation**:
   - **Parameters**:
     - `bmi`: A `Double` value representing the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person.
   - **Operation**: Provides a health recommendation based on the BMI value.
   - **Return**: Returns a `String` message based on the BMI range:
     - If BMI is less than 18.5: "Underweight - You should eat more nutritious food."
     - If BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9: "Normal weight - Keep up the good work!"
     - If BMI is between 25 and 29.9: "Overweight - Consider a balanced diet and exercise."
     - For any other BMI value: "Obesity - Consult a healthcare provider."

### Usage:
1. The code defines two functions, `calculateBMI` and `getHealthRecommendation`, to calculate BMI and provide health recommendations based on the BMI value.
2. It then sets the weight and height of a person (70.0 kg and 1.75 m, respectively).
3. The `calculateBMI` function is called with the weight and height values to calculate the BMI.
4. The `getHealthRecommendation` function is called with the calculated BMI to get a health recommendation.
5. Finally, the BMI value and the health recommendation are printed to the console.

### Example Usage:
```swift
let weight = 70.0  // weight in kilograms
let height = 1.75  // height in meters

let bmi = calculateBMI(weight: weight, height: height)
let recommendation = getHealthRecommendation(bmi: bmi)

print("BMI: \(bmi)")
print("Recommendation: \(recommendation)")
```

### External Libraries or Dependencies:
The code does not rely on any external libraries or dependencies and only uses the Foundation framework provided by Apple.
  
  ## Component Code
  ```jsx
  import Foundation

func calculateBMI(weight: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
    return weight / (height * height)
}

func getHealthRecommendation(bmi: Double) -> String {
    switch bmi {
    case ..<18.5:
        return "Underweight - You should eat more nutritious food."
    case 18.5..<24.9:
        return "Normal weight - Keep up the good work!"
    case 25..<29.9:
        return "Overweight - Consider a balanced diet and exercise."
    default:
        return "Obesity - Consult a healthcare provider."
    }
}

let weight = 70.0  // weight in kilograms
let height = 1.75  // height in meters

let bmi = calculateBMI(weight: weight, height: height)
let recommendation = getHealthRecommendation(bmi: bmi)

print("BMI: \(bmi)")
print("Recommendation: \(recommendation)")
  ```
